<h1>Depaul Marketplace: For the students, by the students </h1>
<br>
<h3>who are we? </h3>
<p>We are five college students who saw an opportunity to create a marketplace website for DePaul University, which currently lacks such a platform. Many students have items they want to sell, and a marketplace could provide them with a helpful way to earn extra income, especially with the cost of tuition.</p>
<br>
<h3>Where did the idea come from? </h3>

<p> Our inspiration came from platforms like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace. We wanted to create a similar space where users can find items by category, with each listing displaying a quick picture and price for easy browsing. </p>
<br>
<h3>Future Plans </h3>

<p> Our goal is to make this website more accessible and aligned with DePaul’s community needs. We plan to introduce features specific to DePaul, such as options related to classes and campuses. For instance, we’ll expand our current campus selection feature so students can see if items fit within specific dorms or receive recommendations based on their classes.</p>
