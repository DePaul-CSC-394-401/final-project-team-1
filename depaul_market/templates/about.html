<h1>About Us </h1>
<br>
<h3>who are we? </h3>
<p>We are five college students who wanted to make a website for our school like a marketplace as DePaul dosnt have one. We see great potential in this as every student have things they want to sell and every college student can use some money especially for tuition. </p>
<br>
<h3>Where did the idea come from? </h3>

<p> We got the idea from creigslist and facebook marketplace and wanted to make something similar where users can find items by catagory and the items would show a quick picture and price. </p>
<br>
<h3>Future Plans </h3>

<p> We plan to make this website more accessable and more intune with DePaul. This means that we are going to add class options and more features like the different campuses you are in. Like our current campus feature we are going to add more where you are able to see if each item fits in your selected dorm and where items are better recommened for you base on classes taken.</p>
